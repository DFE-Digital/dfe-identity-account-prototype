		<h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">You’re eligible to apply for qualified teacher status (QTS) in England</h1>
		<p class="govuk-body">Based on the information you’ve given us you may be eligible for QTS.</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">You can prepare to apply now</h2>
		<p class="govuk-body">
			If you decide to apply, you'll need to provide a range of evidence. We'll ask you
			to upload some scans, photos, or original files, so it's useful to get these now.
		</p>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’ll ask for</h2>

		<p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to provide the following evidence when you apply.</p>

		<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Proof of identity</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">You must provide:</p>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>a passport, national identity card or driving licence that shows your date of birth and nationality.
				This must be valid and have not expired.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="govuk-body">If the name on your proof of identity is different from that on your other documents, you
			need to provide evidence of your name change (for example, a divorce certificate or name change deed).</p>

		<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">2. Proof of qualifications</h3>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>your degree certificate from the awarding university or institution</li>
			<li>an official teacher training certificate from the awarding body (this is not required if your teacher
				training was completed as part of your degree)
			</li>
			<li>a transcript or diploma supplement of the qualification that led you to being a recognised teacher. This
				should be issued by the awarding body and show all the modules you studied and the marks you got for
				each. If your teacher training was completed as part of your degree, you should supply your degree
				transcript.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="govuk-body">Note that you must have completed all of your teacher training qualification in {{
			data["country"] }}.</p>

		<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">3. Proof that you’re recognised as a teacher</h3>

		<p class="govuk-body">The authority or territory that recognises you as a teacher must confirm:</p>

		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>that you've completed a teaching qualification/teacher training</li>
			<li>that you’ve successfully completed any period of professional experience comparable to an induction
				period (if required)
			</li>
			<li>the age ranges and subjects you’re qualified to teach.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to provide a letter that proves your professional recognition as a teacher,
			which you can obtain by contacting:</p>

		<p class="govuk-body app-teaching-authority-address">
			Your authority
			Building
			Street
			County
			Post code
			Country
		</p>

		<p class="govuk-body"><a class="govuk-link" href="#">example@url.com</a></p>

		<p class="govuk-body">This must be dated within 3 months of you applying for QTS.</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">You also need to show evidence of your work history.</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">For each school this should include:</p>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>school name</li>
			<li>school city</li>
			<li>school country</li>
			<li>your job role</li>
			<li>start date</li>
			<li>end date.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Providing certified translations</h2>

		<p class="govuk-body">If your documents are not written in English, you must provide certified translations (at
			your own cost) for your:</p>

		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>qualifications</li>
			<li>transcripts</li>
			<li>proof that you’re recognised as a teacher.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="govuk-body">You do not need translations for ID or change of name documents.</p>

		<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">About certified translations</h3>

		<p class="govuk-body">Translations must be carried out by a certified translator, who must state (on the
			document or a separate certification page) that the translation is a true, accurate and correct rendering of
			the original.</p>

		<p class="govuk-body">Each one must include the date of the translation as well as the certified
			translator’s:</p>

		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>signature</li>
			<li>name and contact details</li>
			<li>official certification seal/stamp or ID number.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Finding a certified translator</h4>

		<p class="govuk-body">We cannot recommend translation providers. You may want to explore translators who are
			members of the <a href="http://www.iti.org.uk/component/itisearch/?view=translators" class="govuk-link"
							  rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Institute of Translating and Interpretation
				(opens in a new tab)</a>. Sometimes a university’s language department can also help.</p>
